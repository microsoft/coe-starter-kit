# FAQ: How the CoE Starter Kit Collects App Connection References and Flow Action Details

## Overview

This document explains how the CoE Starter Kit collects and updates:
- **App Connection References** (connectors used by Canvas Apps and Model-Driven Apps)
- **Flow Action Details** (operations/actions used in Cloud Flows, such as SendEmailV2, UserProfile_V2, etc.)

These details appear in the Power Platform Admin view apps and are stored in the CoE Dataverse environment for governance, compliance, and reporting purposes.

---

## Quick Answer

### App Connection References

**Primary Flow:** `Admin | Sync Template v4 (Apps)` → triggers → `SYNC HELPER | Apps`

**Data Source:** Power Apps for Admins Connector
- API call: `Get App as Admin` operation
- Extracts connection references from the app metadata returned by the admin API

**Entity:** `admin_ConnectionReference`

**Trigger Schedule:** When environment records are created or updated (triggered by the Driver flow)

### Flow Action Details

**Primary Flow:** `Admin | Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details)`

**Data Source:** Power Automate Management Connector
- Parses the flow definition JSON
- Extracts action types (e.g., Office 365 Outlook, SharePoint operations)
- Identifies specific operations (e.g., SendEmailV2, UserProfile_V2)

**Entity:** `admin_FlowActionDetail`

**Trigger Schedule:** When environment records are created or updated (triggered by the Driver flow)

---

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. App Connection References Collection

#### Which Flows Are Responsible?

The collection of App Connection References involves multiple flows working together:

1. **Admin | Sync Template v4 (Driver)** [`AdminSyncTemplatev4Driver`]
   - Main orchestration flow that runs on a schedule (typically daily)
   - Updates environment records, which triggers downstream inventory flows

2. **Admin | Sync Template v4 (Apps)** [`AdminSyncTemplatev4Apps`]
   - Triggered when an environment record is created or updated
   - Retrieves the list of apps in each environment
   - For each app, calls the SYNC HELPER flow

3. **SYNC HELPER | Apps** [`SYNCHELPER-Apps`]
   - Child flow that performs detailed inventory for each individual app
   - **This is where connection references are extracted and stored**

#### How Are Connection References Extracted?

The extraction process works as follows:

```
1. SYNC HELPER | Apps receives an app GUID and environment ID
   ↓
2. Calls "Get App as Admin" (Power Apps for Admins Connector)
   ↓
3. API returns app metadata including:
   - App properties (display name, owner, etc.)
   - connectionReferences object containing all connectors used
   ↓
4. Flow parses the connectionReferences from the response
   ↓
5. For each connection reference:
   - Creates or updates record in admin_ConnectionReference entity
   - Stores: Connector name, Display name, Connection ID, App relationship
   ↓
6. Updates the PowerApp record with connection summary
```

**Key API Operation:**
- **Connector:** Power Apps for Admins (`shared_powerappsforadmins`)
- **Operation:** `Get-AdminPowerApp` / "Get App as Admin"
- **Returns:** Complete app metadata including all connection references

#### Data Stored

The `admin_ConnectionReference` entity stores:
- Connector ID (e.g., `shared_sharepointonline`)
- Connector display name (e.g., "SharePoint")
- Connection ID (specific connection instance)
- Relationship to the parent app (`admin_PowerApp`)
- Created/modified timestamps

---

### 2. Flow Action Details Collection

#### Which Flow Is Responsible?

**Primary Flow:** `Admin | Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details)` [`AdminSyncTemplatev3FlowActionDetails`]

This flow is specifically dedicated to collecting action details from Cloud Flows.

#### How Are Flow Actions Extracted?

The extraction process:

```
1. Triggered when environment record is created/updated
   ↓
2. Retrieves list of Cloud Flows for the environment
   ↓
3. For each flow:
   a. Gets flow definition using Power Automate Management Connector
   b. Parses the flow definition JSON structure
   c. Iterates through all "actions" in the definition
   d. Extracts:
      - Action Type (connector name, e.g., "Office 365 Outlook")
      - Operation (specific action, e.g., "SendEmailV2")
      - Action metadata
   ↓
4. Stores each action in admin_FlowActionDetail entity
   ↓
5. Links action details to parent flow record
```

**Key API Operations:**
- **Connector:** Power Automate Management (`shared_flowmanagement`)
- **Operation:** Get flow definition
- **Parses:** JSON definition to extract `actions` node

#### Data Stored

The `admin_FlowActionDetail` entity stores:
- Action Type (connector/service name)
- Operation (specific operation like "SendEmailV2")
- Relationship to parent flow (`admin_Flow`)
- Action metadata
- Created/modified timestamps

---

### 3. Connection Identities (Additional Context)

There's also a related flow for connection identities:

**Flow:** `Admin | Sync Template v4 (Connection Identities)` [`AdminSyncTemplatev4ConnectionIdentities`]

**Purpose:** Tracks who owns/uses specific connections (the identity behind the connection)

**Entity:** `admin_ConnectionReferenceIdentity`

This complements the connection reference data by tracking the user accounts associated with each connection.

---

## When and How Often Are These Details Refreshed?

### Incremental Mode (Default)

By default, the CoE Starter Kit runs in **incremental mode**:

- **Frequency:** Daily (when Driver flow runs on schedule)
- **Scope:** Only apps/flows modified within the last N days (default: 7 days)
- **Environment Variable:** `admin_InventoryFilter_DaysToLookBack` (default: 7)

**How it works:**
1. Driver flow runs daily (scheduled trigger)
2. Updates environment records with current modification timestamps
3. This triggers downstream flows (Apps, Flows, etc.)
4. Each flow checks: "Has this object changed in the last 7 days?"
5. If yes → full inventory for that object
6. If no → skip to save API calls

### Full Inventory Mode

To capture ALL apps and flows regardless of modification date:

1. Set environment variable `admin_FullInventory` to `Yes`
2. Run the Driver flow manually or wait for scheduled run
3. All apps, flows, and their connections/actions will be inventoried
4. **Remember to set back to `No`** after completion to avoid long-running flows

### On-Demand Refresh

You can trigger a manual refresh:

1. **Via Setup Wizard:** Use the "Run Inventory" function
2. **Manually:** Run `Admin | Sync Template v4 (Driver)` with `admin_FullInventory=Yes`
3. **For specific environment:** Update an environment record (modify any field) to trigger inventory

## How to Review or Customize the Logic

### Viewing the Flows

1. Navigate to your CoE environment in Power Automate
2. Go to **Solutions** → **Center of Excellence - Core Components**
3. Filter by "Cloud flows"
4. Search for:
   - `Admin | Sync Template v4 (Apps)` - App inventory orchestration
   - `SYNC HELPER | Apps` - Detailed app inventory including connections
   - `Admin | Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details)` - Flow actions inventory
   - `Admin | Sync Template v4 (Connection Identities)` - Connection identity tracking

### Editing the Flows

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

1. **Unmanaged Layers:** Editing managed flows creates an unmanaged layer
   - Unmanaged layers prevent automatic updates during CoE Kit upgrades
   - You'll need to remove customizations to receive updates

2. **Best Practice:** Instead of modifying core flows:
   - Create custom child flows for additional logic
   - Use Power Automate's "Run after" patterns
   - Store custom data in separate custom entities

3. **If You Must Customize:**
   - Document all changes
   - Export your customizations before upgrading
   - Be prepared to reapply customizations after upgrades

### Viewing the Data

**In the CoE Admin App:**
- Canvas Apps: Navigate to app details → **Connections** tab
- Cloud Flows: Navigate to flow details → **Connections and Actions** tab

**In Dataverse:**
- Table: `admin_ConnectionReference` - App connection references
- Table: `admin_FlowActionDetail` - Flow action details
- Table: `admin_ConnectionReferenceIdentity` - Connection identities

**In Power BI:**
- Connection data appears in governance and compliance reports
- Action details used for flow analytics dashboards

## Troubleshooting

### Connection References Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** App shows in inventory but "Connections" tab is empty

**Common Causes:**
1. App hasn't been inventoried yet (incremental mode, not modified recently)
   - **Solution:** Run full inventory or update the app to trigger sync

2. SYNC HELPER | Apps flow is failing
   - **Solution:** Check flow run history for errors
   - Verify Power Apps for Admins connection is valid

3. App doesn't use any connections
   - **Expected:** Some apps only use built-in functions

**Verification Steps:**
```
1. Check admin_ConnectionReference table in Dataverse
   - Filter by App GUID
   - Verify records exist

2. Check SYNC HELPER | Apps flow run history
   - Find run for your specific app
   - Look for "Initialize_ActualConnectionsArray" action
   - Verify connectionReferences were parsed
```

### Flow Action Details Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Flow shows in inventory but "Connections and Actions" tab is empty

**Common Causes:**
1. Flow hasn't been inventoried yet (incremental mode)
   - **Solution:** Run full inventory or modify the flow

2. Flow Action Details sync flow is turned off
   - **Solution:** Verify `Admin | Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details)` is turned on

3. Flow definition couldn't be parsed
   - **Solution:** Check flow run history for errors

**Verification Steps:**
```
1. Check admin_FlowActionDetail table
   - Filter by Flow GUID
   - Verify action records exist

2. Check Admin | Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details) run history
   - Look for successful runs for your environment
```

### Stale Data

**Symptoms:** Changes to connections/actions not reflected in CoE

**Common Causes:**
1. Incremental mode not detecting change
   - **Solution:** Manually trigger inventory for that environment

2. Long time since last Driver run
   - **Solution:** Verify Driver flow is running on schedule

**Force Refresh:**
```
1. Option A: Set admin_FullInventory = Yes and run Driver
2. Option B: Update the environment record to trigger inventory
3. Option C: Manually run the specific sync flow for that environment
```
