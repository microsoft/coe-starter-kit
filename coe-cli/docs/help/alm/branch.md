## ALM Maker Solution

The ALM Accelerator branch command allows Makers to create a branch in the source code repository to store and build a Power Platform solution. To run the branch command the repository that is being branched must exist and be initialized with an initial commit

The process will:

1. Create a source code git branch

2. Create build pipelines to validate, test and move to production

### Examples

```bash
coe alm branch \
    -o https://dev.azure.com/contoso \
    -p alm-sandbox \
    -r Operations \
    -d MyTestSolution \
    -s validation=https://contoso-validation.crm.dynamics.com,test=https://contoso-test.crm.dynamics.com,https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com
