# ALM Accelerator for Makers
ALM Accelerator for Makers enables makers to apply source control strategies by using GitHub, and use automated builds and deployment of solutions to their environments without the need for manual intervention by the maker, administrator, developer, or tester. In addition, ALM Accelerator for Makers provides makers the ability to work without intimate knowledge of downstream technologies and switch quickly from developing solutions to implementing source control for the solutionâ€”and, ultimately, pushing their apps to other environments with as few interruptions to their work as possible.
