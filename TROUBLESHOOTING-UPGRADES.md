## TooManyRequests Error During Upgrade

### Issue Description

When upgrading CoE Starter Kit solutions (particularly Core Components) from older versions (e.g., 4.43) to newer versions (e.g., 4.47+, 4.50+), the import process may fail with the following error:

```
Solution "Center of Excellence - Core Components" failed to import: ImportAsHolding failed with exception: 
CanvasApp import: FAILURE: Code: TooManyRequests 
Message: Too many requests sent to a service.
Client Request Id: [GUID]
```

### Root Cause

This is a **known rate-limiting issue** that occurs when:

1. **Multiple Canvas Apps are imported simultaneously**: CoE Starter Kit solutions contain multiple Canvas Apps. During the upgrade process, the Power Platform import service sends multiple concurrent requests to the Canvas App service.

2. **Service protection limits are exceeded**: Microsoft Power Platform enforces service protection limits to ensure fair resource usage and system stability. When upgrading solutions with many Canvas Apps, especially after skipping multiple versions, the number of API calls can exceed these limits.

3. **Large version gaps exacerbate the issue**: Upgrading from significantly older versions (e.g., 4.43 → 4.50.6, spanning 13+ months) includes more Canvas App changes, increasing the likelihood of hitting rate limits.

### Official Documentation

For more information about service protection limits, see:
- [Service protection API limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations)
- [CoE Starter Kit upgrade guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/coe/after-setup)

### Resolution Steps

#### Step 1: Remove Unmanaged Layers (Critical - Must Do First)

Unmanaged customizations block solution updates and must be removed before upgrading.

1. Open the **CoE Admin Command Center** app in your CoE environment
2. Navigate to the **CoE flows** section
3. Identify any flows or components with unmanaged layers (indicated by a layer icon)
4. For each component with an unmanaged layer:
   - Click **See solution layers**
   - Select the unmanaged layer
   - Click **Remove unmanaged layer**
5. Repeat for all CoE solutions (Core, Governance, Nurture, etc.)

**Reference**: [Removing unmanaged layers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/coe/after-setup#installing-upgrades)

#### Step 2: Use Version-by-Version Upgrade Strategy (Recommended)

Instead of jumping directly from 4.43 to 4.50.6, upgrade incrementally:

**Recommended upgrade path from 4.43:**
1. 4.43 → 4.45
2. 4.45 → 4.47
3. 4.47 → 4.49
4. 4.49 → 4.50.6 (or latest)

**Benefits of incremental upgrades:**
- Fewer Canvas Apps to import in each step
- Lower chance of hitting rate limits
- Easier to identify which version introduces issues (if any)
- Allows for testing between major version jumps

**Where to find older versions:**
- Visit the [CoE Starter Kit Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/releases)
- Download the specific version you need for each upgrade step

#### Step 3: Implement Retry Strategy with Proper Timing

If you encounter the TooManyRequests error:

1. **Wait at least 60-90 minutes** before retrying
   - Service protection limits reset over time
   - Waiting longer (2-4 hours) is even better for a clean retry

2. **Avoid concurrent operations during retry**
   - Do not run other solution imports
   - Pause or disable heavy flows temporarily
   - Avoid large data sync operations
   - Do not run bulk API operations

3. **Import during off-peak hours**
   - Early morning (2 AM - 6 AM local time)
   - Late evening (10 PM - 12 AM local time)
   - Weekends when tenant activity is lower

#### Step 4: Import Solutions One at a Time

Instead of importing all CoE solutions together:

1. Import **Core Components** first and verify success
2. Wait 30-60 minutes
3. Import **Governance Components** (if used)
4. Wait 30-60 minutes
5. Import **Nurture Components** (if used)
6. Continue with other solutions as needed

**Important**: Core Components must be imported before other solutions due to dependencies.

#### Step 5: Use the Modern Power Platform Admin Center

While the issue mentions trying the "classic" console, the **modern Power Platform Admin Center is recommended**:

1. Navigate to [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com)
2. Select your CoE environment
3. Go to **Solutions**
4. Import the solution using the **Upgrade** option (default)

The modern admin center provides:
- Better error reporting
- Progress indicators
- Improved retry handling

#### Step 6: Verify Solution Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure:

1. **Environment requirements are met:**
   - Database capacity is sufficient
   - Environment is not in admin mode
   - No ongoing maintenance operations

2. **Flows are in a healthy state:**
   - Open Power Automate in the CoE environment
   - Check for failed or suspended flows
   - Turn off flows that are in a failed state, then turn them back on
   - Address any authentication or connection issues

3. **Dependencies are current:**
   - All dependent solutions are at compatible versions
   - Required connectors are available and not blocked by DLP policies

#### Step 7: Force Version Refresh (If Upgrade Options Don't Appear)

If the system doesn't recognize an upgrade is available:

1. Navigate to **Power Platform Admin Center**
2. Go to your **Environment → Solutions**
3. Open the **CoE Core Components** solution
4. Select **Versions** from the top menu
5. Click **Refresh**
6. Wait a few minutes and check if the upgrade option appears

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### If Issues Persist After All Steps

1. **Export and review logs:**
   - Check the detailed error message in the import history
   - Note the Client Request Id for reference
   - Check if specific Canvas Apps are mentioned in errors

2. **Temporarily disable non-critical flows:**
   - Turn off inventory sync flows
   - Disable cleanup flows
   - Stop any custom flows that interact with CoE data

3. **Consider a staged environment approach:**
   - Test the upgrade in a copy/sandbox environment first
   - Validate the upgrade works before applying to production
   - This helps identify environment-specific issues

4. **Contact support if needed:**
   - While the CoE Starter Kit itself is unsupported, Microsoft Support can help with platform-level rate limiting issues
   - Open a support ticket for the Power Platform service
   - Reference the "TooManyRequests" error and provide the Client Request Id
   - Report your issue on GitHub: [CoE Starter Kit Issues](https://aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues)

### Prevention for Future Upgrades

1. **Upgrade regularly (every 1-3 months):**
   - Smaller version gaps = fewer changes per upgrade
   - Reduces risk of rate limiting
   - Easier to troubleshoot issues

2. **Monitor for unmanaged customizations:**
   - Regularly check for unmanaged layers
   - Use source control for custom modifications
   - Document all customizations

3. **Subscribe to CoE Starter Kit releases:**
   - Watch the GitHub repository
   - Enable notifications for new releases
   - Review release notes before upgrading

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: How long should I wait between retry attempts?
**A:** Wait at least 60-90 minutes. For best results, wait 2-4 hours or perform the retry during off-peak hours.

### Q: Can I skip intermediate versions when upgrading?
**A:** While technically possible, it's **not recommended** for large version gaps (e.g., 4.43 to 4.50.6). Incremental upgrades reduce the number of Canvas App changes per import, lowering the risk of hitting rate limits.

### Q: Will I lose data if I upgrade incrementally?
**A:** No. Using the **Upgrade** option (default) preserves all data and customizations. Each intermediate upgrade builds on the previous version.

### Q: What if I already have unmanaged customizations?
**A:** Document your customizations first, then remove unmanaged layers before upgrading. After the upgrade, re-apply your customizations in a way that doesn't create unmanaged layers (e.g., use separate solutions or properly managed customizations).

### Q: Can I import multiple CoE solutions at the same time?
**A:** No, import them **one at a time** with 30-60 minute gaps between each. Import Core Components first (it's required for others), then Governance, then Nurture, etc.

### Q: What if the error persists after following all steps?
**A:** 
1. Check if there are ongoing platform issues at [Microsoft Service Health Dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/servicehealth)
2. Try importing in a different time window (middle of the night, weekend)
3. Contact Microsoft Support for platform-level rate limiting investigation
4. Report the issue on [GitHub Issues](https://aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues) with full details

### Q: Is this a bug in the CoE Starter Kit?
**A:** No, this is a **platform service protection limit**, not a bug. It's a safeguard to ensure system stability. The CoE Starter Kit contains many Canvas Apps, which can trigger these limits during bulk imports, especially for large version jumps.

### Q: How often should I upgrade the CoE Starter Kit?
**A:** Upgrade every **1-3 months** to avoid large version gaps. This makes upgrades smoother and reduces the risk of rate limiting issues.
