            This is the basic API to 'hook' parts of the framework.   It is like an EventSource
            (which can also write object), but is intended to log complex objects that can't be serialized.

            Write is a generic way of logging complex payloads.  Each notification
            is given a name, which identifies it as well as a object (typically an anonymous type)
            that gives the information to pass to the notification, which is arbitrary.  
            
            The name should be short (so don't use fully qualified names unless you have to
            to avoid ambiguity), but you want the name to be globally unique.  Typically your componentName.eventName
            where componentName and eventName are strings less than 10 characters are a good compromise.  
            notification names should NOT have '.' in them because component names have dots and for them both
            to have dots would lead to ambiguity.   The suggestion is to use _ instead.  It is assumed 
            that listeners will use string prefixing to filter groups, thus having hierarchy in component 
            names is good.

            A DiagnosticListener is something that forwards on events written with DiagnosticSource.
            It is an IObservable (has Subscribe method), and it also has a Subscribe overloads that
            lets you specify a 'IsEnabled' predicate that users of DiagnosticSource will use for 
            'quick checks'.   
            
            The item in the stream is a KeyValuePair[string, object] where the string is the name
            of the diagnostic item and the object is the payload (typically an anonymous type).  
            
            There may be many DiagnosticListeners in the system, but we encourage the use of
            The DiagnosticSource.DefaultSource which goes to the DiagnosticListener.DefaultListener.
            
            If you need to see 'everything' you can subscribe to the 'AllListeners' event that
            will fire for every live DiagnosticListener in the appdomain (past or present).

            <summary>
            DiagnosticSourceEventSource serves two purposes 
            
              1) It allows debuggers to inject code via Function evaluation.  This is the purpose of the
              BreakPointWithDebuggerFuncEval function in the 'OnEventCommand' method.   Basically even in
              release code, debuggers can place a breakpoint in this method and then trigger the
              DiagnosticSourceEventSource via ETW.  Thus from outside the process you can get a hook that
              is guaranteed to happen BEFORE any DiangosticSource events (if the process is just starting)
              or as soon as possible afterward if it is on attach.
              
              2) It provides a 'bridge' that allows DiagnosticSource messages to be forwarded to EventListers
              or ETW.    You can do this by enabling the Microsoft-Diagnostics-DiagnosticSource with the
              'Events' keyword (for diagnostics purposes, you should also turn on the 'Messages' keyword.  
              
              This EventSource defines a EventSource argument called 'FilterAndPayloadSpecs' that defines
              what DiagnsoticSources to enable and what parts of the payload to serialize into the key-value
              list that will be forwarded to the EventSource.    If it is empty, values of properties of the 
              diagnostic source payload are dumped as strings (using ToString()) and forwarded to the EventSource.  
              For what people think of as serializable object strings, primitives this gives you want you want. 
              (the value of the property in string form) for what people think of as non-serialiable objects 
              (e.g. HttpContext) the ToString() method is typically not defined, so you get the Object.ToString() 
              implemenation that prints the type name.  This is useful since this is the information you need 
              (the type of the property) to discover the field names so you can create a transform specification
              that will pick off the properties you desire.  
              
              Once you have the particular values you desire, the implicit payload elements are typically not needed
              anymore and you can prefix the Transform specification with a '-' which suppresses the implicit 
              transform (you only get the values of the properties you specifically ask for.  
            
              Logically a transform specification is simply a fetching specification X.Y.Z along with a name to give
              it in the output (which defaults to the last name in the fetch specification).  
            
              The FilterAndPayloadSpecs is one long string with the following structures
              
              * It is a newline separated list of FILTER_AND_PAYLOAD_SPEC
              * a FILTER_AND_PAYLOAD_SPEC can be 
                  * EVENT_NAME : TRANSFORM_SPECS
                  * EMPTY - turns on all sources with implicit payload elements. 
              * an EVENTNAME can be  
                  * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME / DIAGNOSTC_EVENT_NAME @ EVENT_SOURCE_EVENTNAME  - give the name as well as the EventSource event to log it under.  
                  * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME / DIAGNOSTC_EVENT_NAME   
                  * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME    - which wildcards every event in the Diagnostic source or 
                  * EMPTY                     - which turns on all sources
              * TRANSFORM_SPEC is a semicolon separated list of TRANSFORM_SPEC, which can be 
                  * - TRANSFORM_SPEC               - the '-' indicates that implicit payload elements should be suppressed 
                  * VARIABLE_NAME = PROPERTY_SPEC  - indicates that a payload element 'VARIABLE_NAME' is created from PROPERTY_SPEC
                  * PROPERTY_SPEC                  - This is a shortcut where VARIABLE_NAME is the LAST property name
              * a PROPERTY_SPEC is basically a list of names separated by '.'  
                  * PROPERTY_NAME                  - fetches a property from the DiagnosticSource payload object
                  * PROPERTY_NAME . PROPERTY NAME  - fetches a sub-property of the object. 
            
            Example1:
            
               "BridgeTestSource1/TestEvent1:cls_Point_X=cls.Point.X;cls_Point_Y=cls.Point.Y\r\n" + 
               "BridgeTestSource2/TestEvent2:-cls.Url"
              
            This indicates that two events should be turned on, The 'TestEvent1' event in BridgeTestSource1 and the
            'TestEvent2' in BridgeTestSource2.   In the first case, because the transform did not begin with a - 
            any primitive type/string of 'TestEvent1's payload will be serialized into the output.  In addition if
            there a property of the payload object called 'cls' which in turn has a property 'Point' which in turn
            has a property 'X' then that data is also put in the output with the name cls_Point_X.   Similarly 
            if cls.Point.Y exists, then that value will also be put in the output with the name cls_Point_Y.
            
            For the 'BridgeTestSource2/TestEvent2' event, because the - was specified NO implicit fields will be 
            generated, but if there is a property call 'cls' which has a property 'Url' then that will be placed in
            the output with the name 'Url' (since that was the last property name used and no Variable= clause was 
            specified. 
            
            Example:
            
                "BridgeTestSource1\r\n" + 
                "BridgeTestSource2"
                
            This will enable all events for the BridgeTestSource1 and BridgeTestSource2 sources.   Any string/primitive 
            properties of any of the events will be serialized into the output.  
            
            Example:
            
                ""
                
            This turns on all DiagnosticSources Any string/primitive properties of any of the events will be serialized 
            into the output.   This is not likely to be a good idea as it will be very verbose, but is useful to quickly
            discover what is available.
            
            
            * How data is logged in the EventSource 
            
            By default all data from DiagnosticSources is logged to the DiagnosticEventSouce event called 'Event' 
            which has three fields  
            
                string SourceName, 
                string EventName, 
                IEnumerable[KeyValuePair[string, string]] Argument
            
            However to support start-stop activity tracking, there are six other events that can be used 
            
                Activity1Start         
                Activity1Stop
                Activity2Start
                Activity2Stop
                RecursiveActivity1Start
                RecursiveActivity1Stop
                
            By using the SourceName/EventName@EventSourceName syntax, you can force particular DiagnosticSource events to
            be logged with one of these EventSource events.   This is useful because the events above have start-stop semantics
            which means that they create activity IDs that are attached to all logging messages between the start and
            the stop (see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2015/09/14/exploring-eventsource-activity-correlation-and-causation-features/)
            
            For example the specification 
                
                "MyDiagnosticSource/RequestStart@Activity1Start\r\n" + 
                "MyDiagnosticSource/RequestStop@Activity1Stop\r\n" + 
                "MyDiagnosticSource/SecurityStart@Activity2Start\r\n" + 
                "MyDiagnosticSource/SecurityStop@Activity2Stop\r\n" 
            
            Defines that RequestStart will be logged with the EventSource Event Activity1Start (and the cooresponding stop) which
            means that all events caused between these two markers will have an activity ID assocatied with this start event.  
            Simmilarly SecurityStart is mapped to Activity2Start.    
            
            Note you can map many DiangosticSource events to the same EventSource Event (e.g. Activity1Start).  As long as the
            activities don't nest, you can reuse the same event name (since the payloads have the DiagnosticSource name which can
            disambiguate).   However if they nest you need to use another EventSource event because the rules of EventSource 
            activities state that a start of the same event terminates any existing activity of the same name.   
            
            As its name suggests RecursiveActivity1Start, is marked as recursive and thus can be used when the activity can nest with 
            itself.   This should not be a 'top most' activity because it is not 'self healing' (if you miss a stop, then the
            activity NEVER ends).   
            
            See the DiagnosticSourceEventSourceBridgeTest.cs for more explicit examples of using this bridge.

            A HttpHandlerDiagnosticListener is a DiagnosticListener for .NET 4.6 and above where
            HttpClient doesn't have a DiagnosticListener built in. This class is not used for .NET Core
            because HttpClient in .NET Core already emits DiagnosticSource events. This class compensates for
            that in .NET 4.6 and above. HttpHandlerDiagnosticListener has no public constructor. To use this, 
            the application just needs to call <see cref="P:System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener.AllListeners" /> and
            <see cref="M:System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener.AllListenerObservable.Subscribe(System.IObserver{System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener})"/>,
